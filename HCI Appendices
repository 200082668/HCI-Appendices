Visual Design:
• are the colours chosen appropriate for the fitness app? if no what would like to change about it (follow up question to the top one)

The colour scheme is easy on the eyes and i believe it is a professional type of scheme used as well. 
• Are the text legible and easy to understand on all the pages?
Yes the text is standard and legible, and its also spaced put in a way that its clear to read. I can understand all the text on the pages. 
Content Organization:
• Does the homepage contain all the features you expect to find and use readily in a fitness app? If no, please share any features you feel are missing or could be made more accessible
I mean for me yes, the homepage has all the relevant features.
• Do you find the transition between the pages in the app to be logical and cohesive? if no, please specify what you would alter?
Yes the transitions of the pages make sense to me. I wouldn’t really change that.
Onboarding:
• How would you describe your experience with the initial setup and onboarding process? Were there any steps that you found particularly helpful or challenging?(Onboarding refers to signing up, logging in and setting up your account) 
The sign up is all clear and it has a consistent logic with other well known apps, so its easy to learn how to sign up, especially with the current layout.
Performance:
• NOTE- this will be covered during the observation section.
Accessibility:
• Do you believe the platform is inclusive to user ranging from 18+ upwards? (give an definition of inclusive) (by inclusive we mean curating an environment that is accessible to all adults irrespective of their age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and fitness levels)
Definitely, especially with how you can customise quite a bit with multiple aspects, like the colour scheme. 
• Do you find the screen reader useful??
Its not really something i need personally, but the screen reader is a nice addition to see to make it accessible to other. For example, i do know someone who has dyslexia so i really am glad she would have the screen reader option. Im sure it would be helpful for others too in different ways.
• Are there any features or sections of the app that are not fully accessible to you? Please describe."
No. Everything was fine.
• Do you have any suggestions on how we could improve the app's accessibility for users with disabilities?
Maybe the button sizes can be adjusted? I know the font can be adjusted currently, but having the options to choose button size might help too. For example the button for the streak calendar I noticed was kind of small. Personally I found it ok, but I think others might like the option. 
Help and Support:
• Do you think there is enough support provided if challenges are faced?
Yes. The help section is useful and seems to have the necessary information you need.
• Do you know where to go to find help and support information within the app?
Yes. I think the help section being in the settings is a pretty standard thing with other apps, you know, fitness and non-fitness, that I’ve used so I knew where to expect it to be in this fitness one.  
• Were you provided with clear and easy-to-follow instructions to resolve any issues or errors encountered within the app?
I didn’t really have issues with navigating the app so no.
Overall User Experience:
• If there is one more feature that you like to see in the app what would it be
I’d like a built in alarm clock for the sleep tracker? I know we can have a separate alarm clock outside the fitness app, but I would want one that’s linked to the sleep tracking progress logged in the app, in the sense that there would be an optimal set up for alarms by the app.
• Would you recommend this app to someone else? if you said no why not and if yes why would you?
I would recommend it, yes. 
• Would you be willing to reuse this app based on the current features available? • if no why not?
Yes, I would reuse the app. Especially because of the way I can add my own personal touch with the features.
• Based on our existing features is there anything that you would modify about them?
Not really.

Visual Design:
• are the colours chosen appropriate for the fitness app? if no what would like to change about it (follow up question to the top one)

Yes, the blue and white colour scheme feels very clean and professional. It's calming, which is great for when I'm logging in my yoga sessions or reviewing my progress. I wouldn’t change anything about it; it's perfect for keeping me focused.
• Are the text legible and easy to understand on all the pages?
Yes the text is easy to understand, I have a few concerns with the help and support pages as well as the privacy page where it’s quite dense with text but this is understandable considering it goes over vital and useful information.
Content Organisation:
• Does the homepage contain all the features you expect to find and use readily in a fitness app? If no, please share any features you feel are missing or could be made more accessible
Absolutely, the homepage is great, with the essentials like workout personalisation, goal setting, and tracking. It’s really streamlined, making it super easy to jump right into my daily routine.
• Do you find the transition between the pages in the app to be logical and cohesive? if no, please specify what you would alter?
The transitions of the pages follows a common sense approach and I can’t fault that.
Onboarding:
• How would you describe your experience with the initial setup and onboarding process? Were there any steps that you found particularly helpful or challenging?(Onboarding refers to signing up, logging in and setting up your account) 
The setup process seems straightforward. It feels similar to other apps I’ve used and appears to be clear.
.
Performance:
• NOTE- this will be covered during the observation section.
Accessibility:
• Do you believe the platform is inclusive to user ranging from 18+ upwards? (give an definition of inclusive) (by inclusive we mean curating an environment that is accessible to all adults irrespective of their age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and fitness levels)
Definitely. I love that it’s customisable, which I think makes it welcoming for all users, regardless of their age or fitness level. It's great that I can tweak things like the colour scheme—it just adds that personal touch.
• Do you find the screen reader useful??
I personally don't use screen reader, but I think it's a thoughtful feature. In my opinion, accessibility features like that are important for making sure everyone can benefit from the app.
• Are there any features or sections of the app that are not fully accessible to you? Please describe."
No. Everything was fine.
• Do you have any suggestions on how we could improve the app's accessibility for users with disabilities?
Maybe consider adjustable icon and button sizes? The icons/buttons for some features are a bit small. I manage fine, but having the option to change the size could be a help for others, like those with sight impairment or just personal preference for different sized icons/ buttons.
Help and Support:
• Do you think there is enough support provided if challenges are faced?
From what I’ve seen, yes. The help section is thorough and seems well-equipped to handle any common issues users might encounter. If anything I think it may have too much information and could benefit from a chatbot perhaps.
• Do you know where to go to find help and support information within the app?
Yes, the help section is accessible through settings. 
• Were you provided with clear and easy-to-follow instructions to resolve any issues or errors encountered within the app?
No. this was not necessary as the design was being tested and not an actual application. Errors associated with inputting information or searching weren’t tested. 
Overall User Experience:
• If there is one more feature that you like to see in the app what would it be
It would be good to have a feature that integrates music playlists directly within the app. While working out or winding down with yoga, having my favourite tunes seamlessly integrated into the activity tracker would elevate my experience and keep me motivated.• 
Would you recommend this app to someone else? if you said no why not and if yes why would you?
I think this app is a great initial design so yes.
• Would you be willing to reuse this app based on the current features available? • if no why not?
Yes, I would reuse the app, it is very comprehensive in the features provided.
• Based on our existing features is there anything that you would modify about them?
I think it falls in line with existing apps out there which focus on health and fitness. I can’t seem to think of anything that needs improvement at the moment.
